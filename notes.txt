??custom usleep??--nina-- while loop checking if duration is lower than time before entering loop
??protect each mutex lock/unlock ... triple check



when single philo dies program doesnt exit
improve logic .. currently who takes the next fork? where is the cutoff when philos NEED to die??
thinking does not always happen?

single philo takes fork!

{
valgrind --tool=helgrind → data race detection.

valgrind --tool=drd → fewer false positives, works better for C++11 threads.

check leaks for n_meals & w/o
check leaks for proper ending & death

:::
NO LEAK     when n_meals and died (program exits immediately)
LEAK        when n_meals and died (program exits too late...still prints)
:::

make sure all threads finish before main finishes (double flag logic?)
}
