thinking does not always happen?

make sure program doesnt print anything and exits after death

endless loop when no meals_to_eat specified

what to do when time_to_die < time_to_eat + time_to_sleep?
->just dies??

check if correct number of meals are consumed before exit


{
valgrind --tool=helgrind → data race detection.

valgrind --tool=drd → fewer false positives, works better for C++11 threads.

check leaks for n_meals & w/o
check leaks for proper ending & death
->4x
:::
NO LEAK     when n_meals and died (program exits immediately)
LEAK        when n_meals and died (program exits too late...still prints)
:::

make sure all threads finish before main finishes (double flag logic?)
}
