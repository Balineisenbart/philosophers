add ft_usleep
usleep in main loop?
usleep has a limit - so limit input for time_to_eat/sleep

improve logic .. currently who takes the next fork? where is the cutoff when philos NEED to die??
do thinking only when uneven number of philos?

all are full needs to exit as fast as death is detected

print error when input == 0

.>protect for ulimit -v  (segfault??) -> return to main

limit inputs to min 60ms ->OS tasks scheduling limits

-----------
./philo 5 800 200 200
->death eventually and random timepoints

./philo 5 800 200 200 3
->sometimes death 
...>improve how pilo threads are created? takes too much time?
./philo 5 1000 200 200
->fine!

./philo 3 800 200 200 1
-->doesnt exit early enough!! some eat multiple times

./philo 4 1000 500 50 2
->dies in many cases
