usleep has a limit - so limit input for time_to_eat/sleep
protect ft_usleep ; return when -1
protect print status -- or pass current time.. so utils do not need protection;


improve logic .. currently who takes the next fork? where is the cutoff when philos NEED to die??
do thinking only when uneven number of philos?

all are full needs to exit as fast as death is detected

print error when input == 0

.>protect for ulimit -v  (segfault??) -> return to main

limit inputs to min 60ms ->OS tasks scheduling limits

protect any get_timestamp call
